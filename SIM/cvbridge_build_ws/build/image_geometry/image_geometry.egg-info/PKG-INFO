Description: `image_geometry` contains C++ and Python libraries for interpreting images
            geometrically. It interfaces the calibration parameters in sensor_msgs/CameraInfo
            messages with OpenCV functions such as image rectification, much as cv_bridge
            interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with OpenCV data types.
